# Clerk — AI Helpdesk for Shopify Merchants

## What This Is
A SaaS helpdesk platform built for Shopify merchants — solo owners and small teams who need to handle customer support across multiple channels without a large support staff. Think Zendesk but AI-first, purpose-built for Shopify. The AI agent can read and act on Shopify data (orders, customers, refunds, etc.) directly inside the support workflow.

## Docs
- Production checklist: [`docs/production/checklist.md`](docs/production/checklist.md)
- Deployment guide: [`docs/production/deployment.md`](docs/production/deployment.md)
- Production runbook: [`docs/production/runbook.md`](docs/production/runbook.md)

## Repo Layout
```
clerk/
├── apps/dashboard/     # Next.js 16 — UI + API routes (Clerk.com auth, SWR, Tailwind)
├── apps/gateway/       # Express — webhook receiver + BullMQ worker
└── packages/db/        # Prisma schema + shared @clerk/db client (Neon PostgreSQL)
```

## Maintenance Commands
- `npm run clean` — removes ignored build/test artifacts from the repo root and workspaces: `.turbo/`, `.next/`, `.next-e2e/`, `coverage/`, `dist/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.nyc_output/`, and `*.tsbuildinfo`.
- `npm run clean:deps` — removes `node_modules/` from the repo root and workspaces. Use this only when you intentionally want to reinstall dependencies.
- Preview either cleanup without deleting files by running the underlying script with `--dry-run`, for example `node ./scripts/clean.mjs artifacts --dry-run`.

## Hosting (Production)
- **Dashboard** — Vercel (Next.js 16 serverless)
- **Gateway** — Railway (Express + BullMQ worker, single service)
- **Database** — Neon PostgreSQL (pooled via pgbouncer)
- **Redis** — Upstash (dashboard uses `@upstash/redis` REST client; gateway uses `ioredis` with `REDIS_URL`)
- **Error tracking** — Sentry (required for production observability; apps init when `SENTRY_DSN` is set)

## Request Flow (Inbound Message)
1. External platform POSTs to gateway webhook (Railway URL)
2. Gateway verifies signature (HMAC/Meta), resolves org, enqueues job to BullMQ
3. Worker upserts customer/thread/message, sanitizes input (prompt injection protection), deduplicates by `externalMessageId`
4. Worker enqueues AI summary job → Claude generates 1-sentence summary + tag (Shipping/Returns/Order Status/Product Inquiry/General)
5. After summarizing, worker calls `/api/agent/plan-internal` to generate an agent plan, then sends Telegram notification to all bound org members
6. Dashboard polls `/api/threads?status=open` via SWR every 3s and shows the new thread
7. Agent opens the ticket → auto-plan is shown → agent approves → `POST /api/agent` executes

## Auth & Multi-tenancy
- Clerk.com handles user auth and org management
- `getOrCreateOrg()` maps Clerk org ID → DB `Organization` row
- All DB queries are scoped by `organizationId`

## Channels
- **Email** — complete (Postmark inbound + outbound, reply threading, email quote stripping, AI spam filter on new senders)
- **Instagram DM** — complete (OAuth, inbound webhooks, outbound via page access token, daily token health cron, integrations UI)
- **Telegram** — complete (operator-only, single Clerk bot, inbound via `/webhooks/telegram`, outbound plan notifications to bound org members, yes/no/skip plan approval via reply)
- **Shopify** — complete (OAuth custom app, webhook ingestion for orders/created/fulfilled/updated/cancelled, HMAC verification, KB sync, Orders + Customers dashboard views)
- **TikTok** — not started (type stubs and UI placeholder only)

### Internal Channel Types (not user-facing)
- `dashboard_agent` — thread created for each standalone Concierge chat session on `/dashboard/agent`
- `sms_agent` — thread created when a team member interacts with the agent via Telegram (legacy name)

## AI Agent System
The agent is the core of the product. It operates in two modes:

### Support Mode (ticket threads: ig_dm, email, shopify)
Triggered from the tickets page. When a ticket is opened:
1. **Auto-plan** fires automatically if the last message is from the customer. Calls `/api/agent/plan`, which runs a 2–3 phase Claude tool-use call to generate a `PlanStep[]` without side effects. Plan is cached in `Thread.cachedPlan`.
2. **ActionPlanCard** is shown floating above the composer. Agent reviews proposed steps, can toggle individual steps, approve, dismiss, or regenerate.
3. **Approve** → `POST /api/agent` executes the approved tool calls, then runs the standard tool-use loop for follow-up steps.
4. Agent can also be invoked manually: type `@{agentName}` in the Internal tab composer.

### Operator Mode (dashboard_agent, sms_agent)
Direct interface for the merchant/team. No customer in context — the agent takes instructions and acts on Shopify directly.
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/agent` page has a persistent chat interface (session-based, one `dashboard_agent` thread per session).
- **Telegram**: new ticket notification sent to all bound org members. Reply `yes` to execute the plan, `no` to skip, or type freeform instructions.

### Agent Tools
Tool registry and execution live under `apps/dashboard/src/lib/agent/tools/`.

**Read tools** (no side effects, executed in plan phase 1.5 to inform dependent writes):
- `search_kb` — full-text search of knowledge base articles
- `search_shopify_products` — search product catalog by name/keyword, returns variants + IDs
- `search_shopify_customers` — search by name or email to resolve customer ID
- `get_shopify_customer` — fetch full customer profile (name, email, phone, address, order count)
- `get_shopify_orders` — fetch up to 5 most recent orders for a customer
- `get_order_by_name` — look up order by human-readable number (e.g. `#1234`)

**Action tools** (write to Shopify):
- `update_shopify_customer_info` — update name, email, phone
- `update_shopify_order_address` — update shipping address on unfulfilled order + sync customer default address
- `add_shopify_customer_note` — append note to Shopify customer record
- `create_refund` — full or partial refund on an order
- `cancel_order` — cancel unfulfilled order with restock option
- `create_shopify_order` — create new order on behalf of customer
- `edit_shopify_order` — add/remove/swap line items using Shopify Order Editing API

**Communication tools**:
- `send_reply` — send message on the customer's channel (IG DM, email, etc.)
- `send_email` — send outbound email to any address (works from any channel type)

**Internal tools**:
- `add_internal_note` — add agent note to thread (not visible to customer)
- `update_thread_status` — set open/pending/closed
- `update_thread_tag` — update topic tag

### Agent Settings (stored as JSON on Organization.settings)
Configurable per org via Settings → Agent tab:
- `agentName` — display name and `@mention` trigger (default: "Clerk")
- `aiContext` — brand/store context prepended to system prompt
- `brandVoice` — tone brief appended to system prompt
- `autoPlanOnOpen` — auto-generate plan when ticket opens (default: true)
- `autonomyTier` — preset autonomy level (`watch`/`guarded`/`trusted`/`broad`/`full`); drives runtime defaults via `TIER_DEFAULTS`
- `defaultInstruction` — default agent instruction
- `requireApprovalForActions` — show plan card before executing (default: true)
- `toolsEnabled` — toggle tool categories: `action`, `communication`, `internal`, `read`
- `maxRefundAmount` — dollar cap on refunds (null = unlimited)
- `blockCancellations` — prevent cancel_order calls
- `blockCustomLineItems` — require variant_id on all create_shopify_order line items
- `maxIterations` — max tool-use loop iterations per run (default: 10)
- `replyLanguage` — force reply language ("auto" or ISO name like "Spanish")

### Agent Safety / Guardrails
- 20,000 token budget per run; stops and reports if exceeded
- Prompt injection patterns stripped from all inbound messages in gateway
- Inbound messages truncated at 4,000 chars in gateway
- Rate limiting on agent endpoints via Upstash Redis

## Coding Guidelines
- Don't add features, comments, error handling, or abstractions beyond what's asked
- Don't mock the DB in tests — use real DB connections
- Keep responses concise — skip summaries of what was just done
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Read files before modifying them
- Target user is a solo Shopify merchant or small team — UI and features should optimize for simplicity and speed, not power-user complexity
