# Shopkeeper — AI Support for Shopify Brands

## What This Is
Shopkeeper is an AI operating layer for solo and small e-commerce businesses on Shopify — a general-purpose agent that handles operational work and is reachable from wherever the merchant is (Telegram today; WhatsApp next; the dashboard is one surface, not *the* surface).

**Customer support is the V1 wedge and the current focus.** Think Zendesk but AI-first and purpose-built for Shopify: a multi-channel support inbox plus an AI agent that reads and acts on Shopify data (orders, customers, refunds, etc.) directly inside the workflow. The architecture is built so the same agent core — memory, approval/autonomy workflows, multi-channel interaction, tool use — extends into adjacent workflow modules over time: order operations → inventory & supplier comms → marketing ops → financial ops. Only the support module is built today; the codebase assumes the others will share the core.

Roadmap: [`docs/core-extraction-and-module-expansion-plan.md`](docs/core-extraction-and-module-expansion-plan.md).

## Docs
- Production checklist: [`docs/production/checklist.md`](docs/production/checklist.md)
- Deployment guide: [`docs/production/deployment.md`](docs/production/deployment.md)
- Production runbook: [`docs/production/runbook.md`](docs/production/runbook.md)

## Repo Layout
```
shopkeeper/
├── apps/dashboard/     # Next.js 16 — UI + API routes (Clerk.com auth, SWR, Tailwind)
├── apps/gateway/       # Express — webhook receiver + BullMQ worker
└── packages/db/        # Prisma schema + shared @shopkeeper/db client (Neon PostgreSQL)
```

Local development and all deployed services use Node.js 22.x with npm 10.x.
Run `nvm use` from the repository root to select the version declared in `.nvmrc`.

## Maintenance Commands
- `npm run clean` — removes ignored build/test artifacts from the repo root and workspaces: `.turbo/`, `.next/`, `.next-dev/`, `.next-e2e/`, `coverage/`, `dist/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.nyc_output/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, and `.DS_Store`.
- `npm run clean:deps` — removes `node_modules/` from the repo root and workspaces. Use this only when you intentionally want to reinstall dependencies.
- Preview either cleanup without deleting files by running the underlying script with `--dry-run`, for example `node ./scripts/clean.mjs artifacts --dry-run`.

## Local Gateway Development
- `npm run dev -w apps/gateway` — starts the gateway server and worker without a public tunnel.
- `npm run dev:tunnel -w apps/gateway` — also starts ngrok. Install the ngrok CLI first.
- Set `NGROK_DOMAIN` to use a reserved domain; otherwise ngrok assigns a temporary domain. Set `GATEWAY_PORT` to override port `8080`.

## Hosting (Production)
- **Dashboard** — Vercel (Next.js 16 serverless)
- **Gateway** — Railway (Express + BullMQ worker, single service)
- **Database** — Neon PostgreSQL (pooled via pgbouncer)
- **Redis** — dashboard uses Upstash (`@upstash/redis` REST client) for rate limiting/locks/presence; gateway uses a dedicated per-instance Redis (e.g. Railway Redis) via `ioredis` with `REDIS_URL` for BullMQ. These are separate instances.
## Request Flow (Inbound Message)
1. External platform POSTs to gateway webhook (Railway URL)
2. Gateway verifies signature (HMAC/Meta), resolves org, enqueues job to BullMQ
3. Worker upserts customer/thread/message, sanitizes input (prompt injection protection), deduplicates by `externalMessageId`
4. Worker enqueues AI summary job → Claude generates 1-sentence summary + tag (Shipping/Returns/Order Status/Product Inquiry/General)
5. After summarizing, the worker generates the agent plan in-process (`@shopkeeper/agent` planner) and caches it on the thread, then sends a Telegram or iMessage notification to all bound org members
6. Dashboard polls `/api/threads?status=open` via SWR every 3s and shows the new thread
7. Agent opens the ticket → auto-plan is shown → agent approves → `POST /api/agent` executes

## Auth & Multi-tenancy
- Clerk.com handles user auth and org management
- `getOrCreateOrg()` maps Clerk org ID → DB `Organization` row
- All DB queries are scoped by `organizationId`

## Channels
- **Email** — complete. **Hybrid model**: inbound rail and outbound provider are separate concerns. *Inbound* (customer mail → ticket) uses Postmark forwarding (`{orgId}@inbound.<domain>` → `POST /webhooks/email/inbound` → `process-email` job) plus controlled-rollout native Gmail Pub/Sub/history sync behind `GMAIL_NATIVE_INBOUND`. *Outbound* (replies) is per-integration from `Integration.metadata.provider` — Gmail API or Postmark fallback — with reply threading, quote stripping, and an AI spam filter on new senders. A daily `email-token-health` cron probes Gmail refresh tokens and flags "Reconnect" in Integrations on failure.
- **Instagram DM** — Instagram Login OAuth, isolated inbound webhooks, private media storage, agent image understanding, exact-account replies, and token health are implemented. The live Standard Access DM/image/reply path has passed; lifecycle acceptance and Advanced Access approval remain launch gates
- **Telegram** — complete (operator-only, single Shopkeeper bot, inbound via `/webhooks/telegram`, outbound plan notifications to bound org members, yes/no/skip plan approval via reply)
- **iMessage** — complete (operator-only, platform-wide Photon Spectrum line, merchant binds iPhone via connect code in Integrations, inbound via `/webhooks/photon`, outbound plan notifications with dashboard deep links, yes/no/skip approval via reply)
- **Shopify** — complete (OAuth custom app, webhook ingestion for orders/created/fulfilled/updated/cancelled, HMAC verification, KB sync, Orders + Customers dashboard views)
- **TikTok** — not started (type stubs and UI placeholder only)

### Internal Channel Types (not user-facing)
- `dashboard_agent` — thread created for each standalone Concierge chat session on `/dashboard/agent`
- `sms_agent` — thread created when a team member interacts with the agent via Telegram (legacy name)

## Dashboard Navigation Structure
```
Home                     /dashboard               — daily briefing + open work
Inbox                    /dashboard/tickets       — main support queue
Agent
  Settings               /dashboard/agent/configure — store identity, trust level, voice, duty hours
  Memory                 /dashboard/kb            — knowledge base + brand context
  Review                 /dashboard/review        — approve and refine agent responses
Shop                     /dashboard/orders        — Shopify orders + customers
Workspace
  Billing                /dashboard/settings      — plan, payment, invoices; data export & delete below
  Integrations           /dashboard/integrations  — connect channels and external tools
  Team                   /dashboard/team          — members, roles, and access
  Integrations           /dashboard/integrations  — connect channels and external tools
  Team                   /dashboard/team          — members, roles, and access
```
The standalone Concierge agent chat lives at `/dashboard/agent` (each session opens a new `dashboard_agent` thread); it is reached from the Agent surface rather than the top-level nav.

## AI Agent System
The agent is the core of the product. It operates in two modes:

### Support Mode (ticket threads: ig_dm, email, shopify)
Triggered from the tickets page. When a ticket is opened:
1. **Auto-plan** fires automatically if the last message is from the customer. Calls `/api/agent/plan`, which runs a 2–3 phase Claude tool-use call to generate a `PlanStep[]` without side effects. Plan is cached in `Thread.cachedPlan`.
2. **ActionPlanCard** is shown floating above the composer. Agent reviews proposed steps, can toggle individual steps, approve, dismiss, or regenerate.
3. **Approve** → `POST /api/agent` executes the approved tool calls, then runs the standard tool-use loop for follow-up steps.
4. Agent can also be invoked manually: type `@{agentName}` in the Internal tab composer.

### Operator Mode (dashboard_agent, sms_agent)
Direct interface for the merchant/team. No customer in context — the agent takes instructions and acts on Shopify directly.
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/agent` page has a persistent chat interface (session-based, one `dashboard_agent` thread per session).
- **Telegram**: new ticket notification sent to all bound org members. Reply `yes` to execute the plan, `no` to skip, or type freeform instructions.
- **iMessage**: same operator flows as Telegram — plan pushes include a dashboard deep link; reply `yes` / `no` / `skip N` or freeform from a linked iPhone.

### Agent Tools
Tool registry and execution live in the extracted core under `packages/agent/src/tools/` (`@shopkeeper/agent`).

**Read tools** (no side effects, executed in plan phase 1.5 to inform dependent writes):
- `search_kb` — full-text search of knowledge base articles
- `search_shopify_products` — search product catalog by name/keyword, returns variants + IDs
- `search_shopify_customers` — search by name or email to resolve customer ID
- `get_shopify_customer` — fetch full customer profile (name, email, phone, address, order count)
- `get_shopify_orders` — fetch up to 5 most recent orders for a customer
- `get_order_by_name` — look up order by human-readable number (e.g. `#1234`)

**Action tools** (write to Shopify):
- `update_shopify_customer_info` — update name, email, phone
- `update_shopify_order_address` — update shipping address on unfulfilled order + sync customer default address
- `add_shopify_customer_note` — append note to Shopify customer record
- `create_refund` — full or partial refund on an order
- `cancel_order` — cancel unfulfilled order with restock option
- `create_shopify_order` — create new order on behalf of customer
- `edit_shopify_order` — add/remove/swap line items using Shopify Order Editing API

**Communication tools**:
- `send_reply` — send message on the customer's channel (IG DM, email, etc.)
- `send_email` — send outbound email to any address (works from any channel type)

**Internal tools**:
- `add_internal_note` — add agent note to thread (not visible to customer)
- `update_thread_status` — set open/pending/closed
- `update_thread_tag` — update topic tag

### Agent Settings (stored as JSON on Organization.settings)
Configurable per org via Agent → Configure:
- `agentName` — display name and `@mention` trigger (default: "Shopkeeper")
- `aiContext` — optional store details (policies, products) prepended to system prompt; business name comes from `org.name`
- `brandVoice` — tone brief appended to system prompt
- `autoPlanOnOpen` — auto-generate plan when ticket opens (default: true)
- `autonomyTier` — preset autonomy level (`watch`/`guarded`/`trusted`/`broad`/`full`); drives runtime defaults via `TIER_DEFAULTS`
- `defaultInstruction` — default agent instruction
- `requireApprovalForActions` — show plan card before executing (default: true)
- `toolsEnabled` — toggle tool categories: `action`, `communication`, `internal`, `read`
- `maxRefundAmount` — dollar cap on refunds (null = unlimited)
- `blockCancellations` — prevent cancel_order calls
- `blockCustomLineItems` — require variant_id on all create_shopify_order line items
- `maxIterations` — max tool-use loop iterations per run (default: 10)
- `replyLanguage` — force reply language ("auto" or ISO name like "Spanish")

### Agent Safety / Guardrails
- 20,000 token budget per run; stops and reports if exceeded
- Prompt injection patterns stripped from all inbound messages in gateway
- Inbound messages truncated at 4,000 chars in gateway
- Rate limiting on agent endpoints via Upstash Redis

## Key Features

### Tickets (Inbox)
- Thread list with SWR 3s polling, status tabs (open/closed), channel filter, search
- Conversation view with chat + internal notes tabs

- Activity log tab shows all past agent turns with actions performed

### Knowledge Base (Memory)
- Multi-base (named KBs), multi-article per base
- Articles have tags for context-filtered retrieval (agent gets KB articles matching thread tag)
- Shopify KB sync: imports products/policies from connected Shopify store

### Review
- `/dashboard/review` — approve, refine, and audit agent responses before they go out

### Orders / Customers (Storefront)
- `/dashboard/orders` — Shopify order browser with fulfillment/payment status filters, stat strip, search, pagination
- `/dashboard/customers` — Shopify customer browser
- Orders page has "New thread" action that finds/creates a support thread for a Shopify customer (`POST /api/threads/shopify`)

### Billing
- Stripe subscriptions (starter/pro tiers)
- Checkout, portal, webhook sync, invoice history

### Team
- Org member management via Clerk.com
- Bound Telegram chats and iMessage handles per org member for operator notifications

### Workspace
- `/dashboard/settings`: org name, branding, billing, exports, retention, and workspace deletion
- `/dashboard/integrations`: connect/disconnect Instagram, Shopify, Telegram, iMessage, email, and other channels
- `/dashboard/team`: members, roles, and access
- Personal profile and security live in the avatar menu via Clerk's account portal

## Database Models (packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma)

- **Organization** — one per merchant. Stores Stripe subscription fields + `settings` JSON (agent config).
- **Integration** — one per connected platform per org. Stores access token, external account ID, token expiry.
- **Customer** — unique by `(organizationId, platformId)`. `platformId` is email for email channel, IG sender ID for DMs.
- **Thread** — belongs to org + customer. Has `channelType`, `status` (open/pending/closed), `aiSummary`, `tag`, `shopifyCustomerId`, `cachedPlan` (agent plan cache), soft-delete + archive fields.
- **Message** — belongs to thread. `senderType`: customer/agent/ai/note. Agent action logs are stored as `note` messages prefixed with `__shopkeeper_agent__` (legacy rows may use `__clerk_agent__`).
- **OperatorContext** — persists Telegram operator conversation state per (org, chatId) (history, pendingPlan, pendingDigest, lastOrderNumber). DB-backed, not Redis.
- **OrgMember** — extends Clerk org membership with a bound Telegram chat for operator notifications.
- **KnowledgeBase** — named KB container. `source`: "user" | "shopify".
- **KbArticle** — belongs to org + KB. Has tags for context filtering.
- **Feedback** — in-app NPS/survey (rating + comment + categories).

## Coding Guidelines
- Don't add features, comments, error handling, or abstractions beyond what's asked
- Don't mock the DB in tests — use real DB connections
- Keep responses concise — skip summaries of what was just done
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Read files before modifying them
- Target user is a solo Shopify merchant or small team — UI and features should optimize for simplicity and speed, not power-user complexity
